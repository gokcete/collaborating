# Spaghetti Aglio e Olio

## Ingredients:
- 400g spaghetti
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

## Instructions:

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti.

2. While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Saut√© until the garlic is golden but not browned, about 2 minutes.

3. Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet, tossing to coat the pasta in the garlic-infused oil. If the pasta seems dry, add a bit of the reserved pasta cooking water.

4. Season the pasta with salt and black pepper to taste. Toss until well combined.
