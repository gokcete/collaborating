# Fluffy Pancake Recipe

## Ingredients:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup buttermilk
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- Cooking spray or additional butter for the pan

## Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, and melted butter.

3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps; overmixing can make the pancakes tough.

4. Preheat a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Lightly coat with cooking spray or butter.

5. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.

6. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more cooking spray or butter as needed.

7. Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh berries, or whipped cream.

Enjoy your delicious homemade pancakes!

### Workaholic

A workaholic is a person who is addicted to or compulsively devoted to work. This term is often used to describe individuals who are excessively dedicated to their jobs, frequently working long hours and sacrificing personal time, leisure activities, and sometimes even health, for the sake of their professional pursuits. Workaholics may find it challenging to disengage from work-related tasks, often driven by a strong desire for success, achievement, or the fear of failure. While a strong work ethic can be admirable, being a workaholic implies an imbalance where work dominates one's life to an extent that it may negatively impact other aspects of well-being.
