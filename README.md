## Banana Bread

Ingredients
- 2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 - 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)
- 1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)
- 1 pinch salt
- 3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour

Method
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C):
Butter an 8x4-inch loaf pan.

2. Mash the bananas and add the butter:
In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.

3. Smashing bananas with a fork to make banana bread.
Mix in the remaining ingredients:
Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.

1. Sugar mixed with butter and bananas to make banana bread.
Flour added to a bowl of wet ingredients to make banana bread.
Bake the bread:
Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan.
Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350°F (175°C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.

1. Cool and serve:
Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)

Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.

# Fluffy Pancake Recipe

## Ingredients:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup buttermilk
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- Cooking spray or additional butter for the pan

## Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, and melted butter.

3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps; overmixing can make the pancakes tough.

4. Preheat a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Lightly coat with cooking spray or butter.

5. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.

6. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more cooking spray or butter as needed.

7. Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh berries, or whipped cream.

Enjoy your delicious homemade pancakes!

### Workaholic

A workaholic is a person who is addicted to or compulsively devoted to work. This term is often used to describe individuals who are excessively dedicated to their jobs, frequently working long hours and sacrificing personal time, leisure activities, and sometimes even health, for the sake of their professional pursuits. Workaholics may find it challenging to disengage from work-related tasks, often driven by a strong desire for success, achievement, or the fear of failure. While a strong work ethic can be admirable, being a workaholic implies an imbalance where work dominates one's life to an extent that it may negatively impact other aspects of well-being.
